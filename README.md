# ToDo List
[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/Leezio/todolist/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Leezio/todolist/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

## ⚡️ Quickstart

### 🤖 Development

**Developing inside a container**

The Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. The devcontainer.json file on the root of project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase.

More info [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
